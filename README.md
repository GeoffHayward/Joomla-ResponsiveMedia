Joomla-ResponsiveMedia
======================

This is a Joomla content plugin that allows you to add YouTube, Vimeo, and Instagram content into Joomla articles. All media that is added through this plugin is ready for the responsive web.

To add responsive media to a Joomla article you need only add a token in the following form.

'''{embed:youtube:ItemID}
{embed:vimeo:ItemID}
{embed:instagram:ItemID}

The CSS and HTML are based on research and work by Theirry Koblentz, Anders Andersen and Niklaus Gerber. Their work was kindly documented by Jeff Hobbs at http://embedresponsively.com.

This is the development version of this plugin. For production websites please uses the Joomla installable version of the plugin at http://geoffhayward.eu/code/joomla-responsivemedia.
